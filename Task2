    <p><b>MS DHONI</b></p>
    <p><b>Indian cricketer , 7 July 1981 ( Ranchi )</b></p>
<p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as MS Dhoni, is a legendary Indian cricketer and former captain of the Indian national cricket team. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni is regarded as one of the greatest wicketkeeper-batsmen in the history of cricket.

    Dhoni made his debut in international cricket in December 2004, and soon established himself as a formidable player with his exceptional batting skills and lightning-quick wicketkeeping. He quickly gained recognition for his unorthodox and aggressive playing style, which made him a force to be reckoned with in all three formats of the game.
    
    However, it was his captaincy that elevated Dhoni's stature in world cricket. He took over the reins of the Indian team in 2007 and led them to several historic victories. Under his leadership, India won the ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013, becoming the first captain to achieve this remarkable feat.
    
    Dhoni's calm and composed demeanor on the field earned him the nickname "Captain Cool." He was known for his astute decision-making, ability to handle pressure situations, and remarkable finishing skills. His helicopter shot, a unique batting technique, became one of the most iconic shots in cricket.
    
    Apart from his exceptional cricketing abilities, Dhoni is admired for his humility, sportsmanship, and leadership qualities. He is known for his philanthropic efforts and has been involved in various charitable initiatives, including promoting education and sports in rural areas.
    
    In August 2020, Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket, marking the end of an era in Indian cricket. His impact on the game and his contribution to Indian cricket are unparalleled, making him an iconic figure and an inspiration to aspiring cricketers worldwide.</p>
